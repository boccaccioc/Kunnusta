    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        This week, I created a data structure on my server to hold user data. This data structure holds user IDs
        mapped to the tickers of their stocks of choice, which are then used by the front end to make a call to the api
        to retrieve the stock data for that ticker, which is displayed on that users home page. 
    </p>
    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>
        I have added the google OAuth for allowing users to sign in through google. For users that are signed in, they see
        the stocks that are mapped to their ID in the data base (in my server as of now). Users can hit the customize button,
        and then are able to drag around and change the order of stocks on their home page. This data is saved and 
        sent to the data base, so they are saved to each user (until the server is restarted). Additionally I spent a bit of time
        cleaning up the styling of the site.
    </p>
    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>
       I had issues with my API again this week, I was able to make requests, but some elements in arrays that I need
       the data of were null, which led to a lot of time debugging, as I assumed the error was on my part and not the part of the API.
       I was able to fix this issue, but I am concerned that if this API continues to give me more issues I may have to switch to another API.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
     This week, I learned about how sites manage different users, and how to have an organization like google help with this process.
     Additionally, I now know that API data can be faulty and now that is a spot that I will know to check in my debugging.
    </p>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
      I plan on having all of my site and server up and running through heroku. Additionally, I plan on implementing different
      pages for different equities, and options to add those new equities to your home page equites as a user. Lastly, I plan to move
      all of my user data on to a data base (likely firebase).
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
       I feel that I made significant progress this week, and am confident that I can finish all of the
       things that I have planned for next week.
