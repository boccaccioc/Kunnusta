    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        The API that I am using is called Yahoo Finance Low Latency. 
        This API returns data about the stock in the query, such as price, ticker, trading hours, and price points throughout different times of the most recent day's trading.
        From this data, I return from my server, upon query of a equity name, the ticker of the stock, the price, the date that the data is from, and two arrays (times and the prices that they map to).
        Unfortunately, as of very recently, I cannot access this JSON data due to an excess of API calls for the day,
        but the link to the API is here (https://rapidapi.com/finance.yahoo.api/api/yahoo-finance-low-latency?endpoint=apiendpoint_0361945e-e27c-4b15-a61e-1deddb4ef50a)
        and allows for "Testing Endpoints" without signup, which will show what JSON is returned.
    </p>
    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>
        I had planned to implement user sign in system for this progress report, but I instead opted to work
        on other parts of my project, as a lot of useful information for using these sign ins is still being taught.
        So far, I have a fully functioning server, which returns a JSON that is described in the above section. 
        Additionally, the front-end is functional at a basic level, and allows for viewing a couple of stocks, and information on them,
        incuding a graph of the most recent day's price history (this is done using the vue-trend-chart component).
    </p>
    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>
       I am having some issues with my API, but really don't want to switch. I am hoping that the API will function correctly tomarrow
       and only stopped working due to an excess of requests made (it abruptly stopped working after no changes were made to the server)
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I really feel that I am much better and more confident at using different resources online, such as APIs and components. 
      This is something that used to really intimidate and frustrate me, but I am at a point now where I can read the documentation
      and be able out how to implement it in my project in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to add in some basic home page customization, as well as implementing the log in system for the next progress check.
      Additionally I plan on starting to create some tests, so that I do not have to do all my test making at the last minute on the final progress check.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am overall confident that I can implement many of the features that I hoped to,
        but I am also starting to realize that some of the things I hoped to do,
        such as a paper trading page, might be to ambitious. Over the next week I will see if I can try to 
        figure out ways to make more feasible implementations of some of these kinds of features that I want.
