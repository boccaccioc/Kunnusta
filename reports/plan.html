    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
        I plan to make a site that allows for users to see financial data of 
        companies that are publicly traded to allow for people to educate themselves
        and monitor investments that they have made. Ideally, I would have more advanced
        features such as the ability for data to be displayed on graphs, and comparisons
        of certain metrics to be made between companies over time.
    </p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
       This site will allow include functionality such as organizing what metrics are shown,
       ther order in which they appear, what statistics show up on graphs, and overall styling
       of multiple diffent parts of the page. When a user bookmarks a stock, it will be
       saved in a database that they bookmarked that stock, and there will be an option for 
       the user to select the number of shares that they own, so profit/losses can be displayed.
       The user will also be able to customize where things go on their homepage, which will be
       stored in the database.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>
       I plan to use this API (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) which will allow 
       for method calls to recieve JSON's of each equities price history.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Structure</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to use a JSON file that is an array of users. For each user there will be
      data about what stocks are bookmarked, and the amount of the stock the user reports
      owning of the stock, as well as data logging how their homepage was structured.
    </p>
    <h2>UI Design</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Anticipated Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <h5> Progress Check #1 </h5>
           <p> 
               At this point, I plan to be able to display most of the information
                for some select companies, and have a data structure created to allow for logging
                in and seeing a page unique to that log in. I will check this progress by attempting
                sign into different accounts and test that the home screen is representative of what is in 
                the data.
           </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5> Progress Check #2 </h5>
            <p> 
                For the second progress check, I plan to have implemented an administrator account
                that has the ability to see data from users. Additionally I plan to have any stock data 
                available through some search function. I will test this by signing into the administrator 
                account and making sure that they can view the data and that it is accurate.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <h5> Progress Check #3 </h5>
            <p> 
                For the third check, I plan to have fully customizable home screens for each 
                user that have desired styling and equities displayed. The visuals of the site as well as the 
                code will be cleaned up, and debugging and handling of exceptions will be fleshed out. I will test
                this stage by trying to test edge cases and cause errors and make sure that most of the obvious
                errors are handled.
            </p>
